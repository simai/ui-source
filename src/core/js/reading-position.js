// The reading position of a scrolling column (duplication audit 2026-11-03,
// A-6): what a feed, a log, a conversation or a long list does to keep a
// person's place while its content changes under them. It was written in
// ui-pro's sf-message-log (keep the place while history is added above,
// follow the end only when the reader is there, «to the latest», ask once
// when the top is reached), and the end-of-list loading again in
// sf-chat-threads and the ui-chat pilot. One rule now, for every column:
//
//   const position = readingPosition(scroller, {onStart: () => askEarlier()});
//   position.keep(() => column.prepend(fragment));  // the place does not move
//   const follow = position.atEnd();                  // before an append
//   column.append(node);
//   if (follow) position.toEnd();
//   scroller.addEventListener('scroll', () => position.check());
//
//   const stop = watchEdge(sentinel, () => askMore()); // the end came into reach
//
// It owns no content and fetches nothing: it measures one element and says
// when an edge is reached. The element is the scroller -- the box with
// overflow that a person scrolls.
//
// Nothing here keeps state at module scope: each column gets its own
// controller, so the copies of this module that every bundle carries cannot
// disagree (bundles each carry their own module copy).

// lines of text and an entry's action row: closer than that, a person reading
