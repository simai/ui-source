// What language a component speaks, and how a product adds one.
//
// The Framework speaks English by default and whatever the page says otherwise:
// the language is the nearest [lang] above the node, else the document's, else
// English. One rule for every component, so a page never mixes two because two
// components looked in different places.
//
// Until 2026-10-10 that was the whole of it, and every component carried a
// dictionary of exactly two languages written into its source. Adding a third
// meant editing sixteen files, and a product that needed one could not add it
// at all. There will be many more than two (owner, 2026-10-11), so the
// dictionaries a component ships are now a FLOOR rather than the whole set:
// anything can be registered beside them, for any language, including one the
// Framework has never heard of.
//
// Where a word comes from, in order:
//
//   1. the component's own attribute — a consumer who names a word has named
//      it, and no language changes it;
//   2. a word registered for the resolved language;
//   3. the word the component ships for that language;
//   4. the same two again for the language without its region (`pt-BR` → `pt`);
//   5. the same two again for English;
//   6. the key itself, which is a visible defect rather than a blank.
//
// Registering is additive and reversible, and it does not require the
// Framework to know the language exists.

// The state is shared between every copy of this module, which there are
// several of: core, each smart component and each composite are separate
// bundles, and each one carries its own copy of this file. With the registry
// in module scope the page had as many registries as bundles -- `SF.language`
// was published from core's copy, the table read its own, and registering a
// language changed nothing on screen. Only a browser shows that, and it did
// (2026-10-11).
